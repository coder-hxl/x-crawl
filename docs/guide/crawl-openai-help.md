      There are several important aspects to consider when working with crawlers:

      1. **Robots.txt:** It's important to respect the rules set in a website's robots.txt file. This file specifies which parts of a website can be crawled by search engines and other bots. Not following these rules can lead to your crawler being blocked or even legal issues.

      2. **Crawl Delay:** It's a good practice to implement a crawl delay between your requests to a website. This helps to reduce the load on the server and also shows respect for the server resources.

      3. **User-Agent:** Always set a descriptive User-Agent header for your crawler. This helps websites identify your crawler and allows them to contact you if there are any issues. Using a generic or misleading User-Agent can also lead to your crawler being blocked.

      By keeping these points in mind, you can ensure that your crawler operates efficiently and ethically.
